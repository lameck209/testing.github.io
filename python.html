      installation, data types: Int, float, Boolean, string, and list;
      variables, expressions, statements, precedence of operators, comments;
      modules, functions-- - function and its use, flow of execution, parameters
      and arguments. Introduction to Python and installation: Python is a widely
      used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was initially
      designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software
      Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and
      its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.
      Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate
      systems more efficiently. There are two major Python versions- Python 2
      and Python 3. • On 16 October 2000, Python 2.0 was released with many new
      features. • On 3rd December 2008, Python 3.0 was released with more
      testing and includes new features.

      <strong>Why to use Python</strong>: The following are the primary factors to use python in
      day-to-day life: <ol>1. Python is object-oriented Structure supports such
        concepts as polymorphism, operation overloading and multiple inheritance.</ol>
        <ol>2. Indentation Indentation is one of the greatest feature in python</ol> 
        <ol> 3.
            It’s free (open source) Downloading python and installing python is free
            and easy </ol>
            <ol>4. It’s Powerful  Dynamic typing  Built-in types and tools 
                Library utilities Third party utilities (e.g. Numeric, NumPy, sciPy) 
                Automatic memory management </ol>
                <ol>5. It’s Portable Python runs virtually every
                    major platform used today As long as you have a compaitable python
                    interpreter installed, python programs will run in exactly the same
                    manner, irrespective of platform.</ol>
                    <ol>6. It’s easy to use and learn No
                        intermediate compile  Python Programs are compiled automatically to an
                        intermediate form called byte code, which the interpreter then reads. 
                        This gives python the development speed of an interpreter without the
                        performance loss inherent in purely interpreted languages.Structure and
                        syntax are pretty intuitive and easy to grasp.</ol>
                        <ol>7. Interpreted Language
                            Python is processed at runtime by python Interpreter </ol>
                            <ol>8. Interactive
                                Programming Language Users can interact with the python interpreter
                                directly for writing the programs </ol>
                                <ol>9. Straight forward syntax The formation
                                    of python syntax is simple and straight forward which also makes it
                                    popular.</ol>
