  <h2><strong> INTRODUCTION DATA, EXPRESSIONS, STATEMENTS</strong></h2>
  <p>Introduction to Python and
    installation, data types: Int, float, Boolean, string, and list;
    variables, expressions, statements, precedence of operators, comments;
    modules, functions-- - function and its use, flow of execution, parameters
    and arguments. Introduction to Python and installation: Python is a widely
    used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was initially
    designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software
    Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and
    its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.
    Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate
    systems more efficiently. There are two major Python versions- Python 2
    and Python 3. • On 16 October 2000, Python 2.0 was released with many new
    features. • On 3rd December 2008, Python 3.0 was released with more
    testing and includes new features.

    <strong>Why to use Python</strong>: The following are the primary factors to use python in
    day-to-day life:
  <ol>
    <li>Python is object-oriented Structure supports such
      concepts as polymorphism, operation overloading and multiple inheritance.</li>
    <li>Indentation Indentation is one of the greatest feature in python</li>
    <li>It’s free (open source) Downloading python and installing python is free
      and easy</li>
    <li> It’s Powerful Dynamic typing Built-in types and tools
      Library utilities Third party utilities (e.g. Numeric, NumPy, sciPy)
      Automatic memory management</li>
    <li>It’s Portable Python runs virtually every
      major platform used today As long as you have a compaitable python
      interpreter installed, python programs will run in exactly the same
      manner, irrespective of platform.</li>
    <li>It’s easy to use and learn No
      intermediate compile Python Programs are compiled automatically to an
      intermediate form called byte code, which the interpreter then reads.
      This gives python the development speed of an interpreter without the
      performance loss inherent in purely interpreted languages.Structure and
      syntax are pretty intuitive and easy to grasp.</li>
    <li>Interpreted Language
      Python is processed at runtime by python Interpreter</li>
    <li> Interactive
      Programming Language Users can interact with the python interpreter
      directly for writing the programs </li>
    <li>Straight forward syntax The formation
      of python syntax is simple and straight forward which also makes it
      popular.</li>
