        HTML PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
    </h1>
    <P>
        HTML, in full hypertext markup language, a formatting system for displaying material retrieved over the
        Internet. Each retrieval unit is known as a Web page (from World Wide Web), and such pages frequently contain
        hypertext links that allow related pages to be retrieved. HTML is the markup language for encoding Web pages. It
        was designed by the British scientist Sir Tim Berners-Lee at the CERN nuclear physics laboratory in Switzerland
        during the 1980s. HTML markup tags specify document elements such as headings, paragraphs, and tables. They mark
        up a document for display by a computer program known as a Web browser. The browser interprets the tags,
        displaying the headings, paragraphs, and tables in a layout that is adapted to the screen size and fonts
        available to it.
        HTML documents also contain anchors, which are tags that specify links to other Web pages. An anchor has the
        form <A HREF=“http://www.britannica.com”> Encyclopædia Britannica</A>, where the quoted string is the URL
        (universal resource locator) to which the link points (the Web “address”) and the text following it is what
        appears in a Web browser, underlined to show that it is a link to another page. What is displayed as a single
        page may also be formed from multiple URLs, some containing text and others graphics.

        XML, in full extensible markup language, a document formatting language used for some World Wide Web pages. XML
        began to be developed in the 1990s because HTML (hypertext markup language), the basic format for Web pages,
        does not allow the definition of new text elements; that is, it is not extensible. XML is a simplified form of
        SGML (standard generalized markup language) intended for documents that are published on the Web. Like SGML, XML
        uses DTDs (document type definitions) to define document types and the meanings of tags used in them. XML adopts
        conventions that make it easy to parse, such as that document entities are marked by both a beginning and an
        ending tag. XML provides more kinds of hypertext links than HTML, such as
        bidirectional links and links relative to a document subsection.
        Because an author may define new tags, an XML DTD must also contain rules that instruct a Web browser how to
        interpret them—how an entity is to be displayed or how it is to generate an action such as preparing an e-mail
        message.
