   <strong> <h1>C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h1></strong>
   <p> C# is a modern object-oriented, general-purpose programming 
        language, created and developed by Microsoft together with the .NET 
        platform. There is highly diverse software developed with C# and on the .NET 
        platform: office applications, web applications, websites, desktop applications, 
        mobile applications, games and many others.
        C# is a high-level language that is similar to Java and C++ and, to some 
        extent, languages like Delphi, VB.NET and C. All C# programs are object oriented. They consist of a set of definitions in classes that contain methods 
        and the methods contain the program logic  the instructions which the 
        computer executes. You will find out more details on what a class, a method 
        and C# programs are in the next chapter.
        Nowadays C# is one of the most popular programming languages. It is 
        used by millions of developers worldwide. Because C# is developed by 
        Microsoft as part of their modern platform for development and execution of 
        applications, the .NET Framework, the language is widely spread among 
        Microsoft-oriented companies, organizations and individual developers. For 
        better or for worse, as of this book writing, the C# language and the .NET 
        platform are maintained and managed entirely by Microsoft and are not 
        open to third parties. Because of this, all other large software corporations 
        like IBM, Oracle and SAP base their solutions on the Java platform and use 
        Java as their primary language for developing their own software products.
        Unlike C# and the .NET Framework, the Java language and platform are 
        open-source projects that an entire community of software companies, 
        organizations and individual developers take part in. The standards, the 
        specifications and all the new features in the world of Java are developed by 
        workgroups formed out of the entire Java community, rather than a single 
        company (as the case of C# and .NET Framework).</p>

        <p> The C# language is distributed together with a special environment on which 
            it is executed, called the Common Language Runtime (CLR). This 
            environment is part of the platform .NET Framework, which includes CLR, a 
            bundle of standard libraries providing basic functionality, compilers, 
            debuggers and other development tools. Thanks to the framework CLR 
            programs are portable and, once written they can function with little or no 
            changes on various hardware platforms and operating systems. C# programs 
            are most commonly run on MS Windows, but the .NET Framework and CLR 
            also support mobile phones and other portable devices based on Windows 
            Mobile, Windows Phone and Windows 8. C# programs can still be run under 
            Linux, FreeBSD, iOS, Android, MacOS X and other operating systems through 
            the free .NET Framework implementation Mono, which, however, is not 
            officially supported by Microsoft.C# is a modern object-oriented, general-purpose programming
