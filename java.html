    <strong><h1>JAVA SCRIPT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h1></strong>
    <p>
      JavaScript is the scripting language of the Web. JavaScript is used in
      millions of Web pages to add functionality, validate forms, detect
      browsers, and much more. Introduction to JavaScript JavaScript is used in
      millions of Web pages to improve the design, validate forms, detect
      browsers, create cookies, and much more. JavaScript is the most popular
      scripting language on the Internet, and works in all major browsers, such
      as Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera. What is JavaScript? 
      JavaScript was designed to add interactivity to HTML pages JavaScript is
      a scripting language  A scripting language is a lightweight programming
      language JavaScript is usually embedded directly into HTML pages 
      JavaScript is an interpreted language (means that scripts execute without
      preliminary compilation)  Everyone can use JavaScript without purchasing
      a license Java and JavaScript are two completely different languages in
      both concept and design! Java (developed by Sun Microsystems) is a
      powerful and much more complex programming language - in the same category
      as C and C++.

      <h2><strong>What can a JavaScript Do ?</strong></h2>  
<ol>1.JavaScript gives HTML designers a programming tool - HTML authors are normally not 
    programmers, but JavaScript is a scripting language with a very simple syntax! Almost anyone can 
    put small "snippets" of code into their HTML pages </ol> 
    <ol>2.JavaScript can put dynamic text into an HTML page - A JavaScript statement like this: 
        document. </ol>
        <ol>3.JavaScript can react to events - A JavaScript can be set to execute when something happens, 
            like when a page has finished loading or when a user clicks on an HTML element </ol>
            <ol>4.JavaScript can read and write HTML elements - A JavaScript can read and change the content 
                of an HTML element </ol>
                <ol>5.JavaScript can be used to validate data - A JavaScript can be used to validate form data before 
                    it is submitted to a server. This saves the server from extra processing </ol>
                    <ol>6.JavaScript can be used to detect the visitor's browser - A JavaScript can be used to detect the 
                        visitor's browser, and - depending on the browser - load another page specifically designed for that 
                        browser.</ol>
                        <ol>7.JavaScript can be used to create cookies - A JavaScript can be used to store and retrieve 
                            information on the visitor's computer.</ol>

 



 
  <h3><strong>JavaScript Variables</strong></h3> 
Variables are "containers" for storing information.
JavaScript variables are used to hold values or expressions.
A variable can have a short name, like x, or a more descriptive name, like carname.
Rules for JavaScript variable names:
Variable names are case sensitive (y and Y are two different variables) 
Variable names must begin with a letter or the underscore character 
Note: Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, variable names are case-sensitive.
Example
A variable's value can change during the execution of a script. You can refer to a variable by its name to 
display or change its value.
<html>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">
var firstname;
firstname="Welcome";
document.write(firstname);
document.write("<br />");
firstname="XYZ";
document.write(firstname);
</script>
<p>The script above declares a variable,
assigns a value to it, displays the value, change the value,
and displays the value again.</p>
</body>
</html>
Output : 
Welcome
XYZ
The script above declares a variable, assigns a value to it, displays the value, change the value, and 
displays the value again
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
